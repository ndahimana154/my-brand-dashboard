                <span> 2019: Foundations in Web Design and Programming </span>
                <p>
                  In 2019, I took my first steps into the world of web
                  development by immersing myself in HTML and CSS. These
                  foundational languages empowered me to craft visually stunning
                  and well-structured web pages. Eager to deepen my
                  understanding of programming, I ventured into the realm of C
                  and C++, where I honed my skills in logic and algorithmic
                  thinking.

                  2020: Expanding Horizons with JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP
                </span>
                <p>
                  Building on my foundation, 2020 was a year of expansion and
                  exploration. I embraced JavaScript, unlocking the power to
                  create dynamic and interactive web experiences. Venturing into
                  database management, MySQL became my ally in organizing and
                  retrieving data efficiently. Additionally, mastering PHP
                  enabled me to develop robust server-side solutions, laying the
                  groundwork for dynamic web applications.

                <p>
                  In 2021, fueled by a desire to create meaningful impact, I
                  embarked on an entrepreneurial journey. Teaming up with
                  Akimana, we embarked on the development of the Ireme Schools
                  Information System. Our goal was simple yet ambitious: to
                  provide comprehensive management solutions for schools,
                  empowering educators and administrators alike. From inception
                  to its successful hosting on iremeschool.rw in 2024, the
                  project epitomized our commitment to innovation and
                  problem-solving.

                <p>
                  During a holiday break in 2023, I embarked on another
                  entrepreneurial endeavor with the creation of Kickside Rw.
                  Recognizing the need for a centralized platform for Rwandan
                  sports information, I set out to build a robust newspaper that
                  would serve as a hub for sports enthusiasts and industry
                  professionals alike. From storing participant data to
                  delivering timely news updates, Kickside Rw aimed to redefine
                  sports journalism in Rwanda, and it's now hosted on
                  kickside.rw.

                  As I reflect on my journey, I'm humbled by the lessons
                  learned, the challenges overcome, and the achievements
                  celebrated. Yet, this is just the beginning. With each project
                  and endeavor, I'm fueled by a passion for innovation and a
                  commitment to leveraging technology for positive change. As I
                  continue to grow and evolve as a web developer and
                  entrepreneur, I'm excited to embrace new opportunities, tackle
                  new challenges, and make a lasting impact in the world of web
                  development.
